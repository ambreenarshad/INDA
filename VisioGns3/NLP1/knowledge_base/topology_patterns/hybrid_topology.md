# Hybrid/Mixed Topology

## Description
A hybrid topology combines two or more different topology types to create a complex network that leverages advantages of each topology type.

## Characteristics
- Combines multiple topology types
- Can include star, tree, bus, ring elements
- Flexible and scalable
- Common in enterprise networks

## Keywords
- "hybrid"
- "mixed"
- "heterogeneous"
- "complex"
- "multi-tier"
- "layered"

## Common Patterns
- Star-Bus: Multiple star networks connected via bus
- Star-Ring: Multiple star networks in ring configuration
- Tree-Star: Tree topology with star configurations at leaves
- Three-tier: Hierarchical with core, distribution, access layers

## Example Patterns
```
Three-tier network:
  Core: Routers interconnected
  Distribution: Switches connected to routers
  Access: End devices connected to switches
```

## Use Cases
- Enterprise networks
- Campus networks
- Large organizations
- Complex requirements
